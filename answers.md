So we can ensure row level accessability. PK values are unique.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

A foreign Key

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.

Wer need a joining/intermediary table. It creates a 1:many relationship between each table.
